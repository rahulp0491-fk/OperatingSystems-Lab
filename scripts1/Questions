4. To print the contents of a file from a given line number to another given line

5. To generate all combinations of 1,2 and 3 using for loops.

7. To print numbers from 1 to 10, using until construct.

8. Move all hidden files from a given directory to a newly created directory.

9. Which accepts a name as argument and then checks whether it exists as a

exists as an ordinary file, then remove the file and create a directory with the
